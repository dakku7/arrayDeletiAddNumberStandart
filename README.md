# Dynamic Array Management in C++

## Project Overview

This project implements a dynamic array management system in C++. It allows users to perform various operations on a dynamically allocated array, including adding and deleting elements, as well as inserting and removing elements at specific indices. The program utilizes basic memory management techniques to ensure efficient use of resources.

## Features

- **Dynamic Array Creation**: Users can create an array of a specified size, filled with random integers.
- **Add Element**: Users can add an element to the end of the array.
- **Delete Element**: Users can delete all occurrences of a specified element from the array.
- **Add Element at Index**: Users can insert an element at a specific index, with error handling for invalid indices.
- **Delete Element at Index**: Users can remove an element at a specified index, with error handling for invalid indices.
- **Display Array**: The current state of the array can be displayed at any time.

## Usage

1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the executable.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter the size of the array and perform various operations.

## Code Structure

- **showArray**: Displays the contents of the array.
- **fillArray**: Fills the array with random integers.
- **copyArray**: Copies elements from one array to another.
- **addElement**: Adds an element to the end of the array.
- **deleteElement**: Deletes all occurrences of a specified element from the array.
- **addElementIndex**: Inserts an element at a specified index.
- **deleteElementIndex**: Removes an element at a specified index.

## Requirements

- C++11 or later
- A standard C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
